- The terms supervised and unsupervised learning would seem to exhaustively classify machine learning paradigms, except they do not. 
- Policy: A policy is a mapping from perceived states of the environment to actions to be taken when in those states. 
- Reward: A reward signal defines the goal of a reinforcement learning problem. 
- Reward: The reward signal is the primary basis for altering the policy 
- Value function: The value of a state is the total amount of reward an agent can expect to accumulate over the future, starting from that state. 
- Reward vs Value: Rewards are in a sense primary, whereas values, as predictions of rewards, are secondary.
- State: Formally, a state is a function of history
